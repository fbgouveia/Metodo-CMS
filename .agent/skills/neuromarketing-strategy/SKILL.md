# Neuromarketing Strategy Skill

This skill provides the foundation for persuasive communication and design based on how the human brain processes information and makes decisions.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Neuromarketing & Brain Systems
- **System 1 vs System 2:** Designing for fast, intuitive, emotional responses (System 1) and supporting them with logical justification (System 2).
- **The Primal Brain:** Focus on self-interest, contrast, tangible results, and visual cues.
- **Pain vs Pleasure:** Prioritize "Pain Aversion" – identifying the user's current suffering and showing a clear escape route.

### 2. Persuasion Frameworks
- **Cialdini's 7 Principles:** Authority, Reciprocity, Social Proof, Scarcity, Liking, Commitment/Consistency, and Unity.
- **Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAP):** Ensuring Motivation, Ability (low friction), and Prompts coincide.
- **Micro-copy Persuasion:** Using active verbs, reducing "cognitive load," and framing costs as "investments."

### 3. Neuroesthetics (Visual Persuasion)
- **Hierarchy of Attention:** F-Patterns, Z-Patterns, and isolation of the "Call to Action."
- **Color Psychology:** Using contrast to drive action, not just aesthetics (avoiding violet/purple as per project rules).
- **Processing Fluency:** Making information easy to digest to build trust.

### 4. Behavioral Economics
- **Loss Aversion:** Highlighting what the user loses by NOT acting.
- **Anchoring:** Using reference points to make price/value clear.
- **Choice Architecture:** Limiting choices to prevent analysis paralysis.

### 5. Emotional Storytelling
- **Dopamine Loops:** Building curiosity and reward pathways.
- **The Hero's Journey:** Positioning the user as the Hero and the product as the Guide.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Ethical Boundary:** Never use lies or deception. Focus on "Extreme Truth" – highlighting real benefits and real pains.
- **Tone:** Professional, psychological, empathetic, and strategic.
- **Hierarchy:** First solve the PAIN, then offer the GAIN.
